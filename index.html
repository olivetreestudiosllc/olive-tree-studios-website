        <h1>Olive Tree Studios</h1>

        <h2>Olive Avenue</h2>
        <p>Set in a suburban Pennsylvania town, Olive Avenue follows teens/young adults Roy Strofferson and Nate Riley on their journey through everything that the late 2010's and early 2020's has to offer. Too young to be a 90's baby, too old to amused by Gen-Z brainrot, this modern animated take on the humor found in King of the Hill and Seinfield is nothing but ordinary.</p>

        <!-- call to action -->
        <h2>Who are we?</h2>
        <p>Blender may be free, but making ideas happen is not!</p>
        <p>
            We are a fledgling independent studio with one simple goal. Empowering those with ideas by providing the resources and structure to make them happen. Ideas are easy to come up with, hard to actually get them made.
            <br>
            Starting with Olive Avenue as our flagship series, we're taking a massive step at laying a foundation for us to support that goal. Olive Tree Studios is made possible by independent commissioned collaborators across the globe, working together to make Olive Avenue and beyond a reality. Every commissioned contributor building things from the ground up, pouring their hearts into making our productions special.
