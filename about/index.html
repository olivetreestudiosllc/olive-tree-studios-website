    <!-- ABOUT CONTENT -->

        <div class="hero-block">
            <h1 class="olive-bold">Olive Tree Studios</h1>

            <p>
                Founded in May of 2025 by <a href="https://bluecolty.com" class="navbar-text">Bluecolty</a>, this ragtag fledgling studio is still just beginning to properly write its “About”.
            </p>
            <p>
                Registered to a quiet little property in Arkansas, owned by the founder, our studio started with the simple goal of empowering those with good ideas, bringing resources and scalability to productions that would otherwise not get started.
            </p>
            <p>
                That's who we want to be anyways. To do that, we have to get started somewhere. Olive Avenue (<a href="https://olive-avenue.net" class="navbar-text">https://olive-avenue.net</a>) is the vessel actively pushing that goal forward. We're not much, but there's one thing that us and our contributors do have — motivation. Whether that be motivation of turning dreams true, or working against the monopolistic systems of established studios. Or just plain wanting to make something cool and having fun while doing it. Whatever the reason is, we're here to make a difference.
            </p>

            <h2 class="olive-bold">Why "Olive Tree"?</h2>
            <p>
                Many reasons. Our logo is born not only from the very nature of vertices and edges in 3D, but also of nodes. Nodes being connected. Our vision is to serve as the central hub for future productions, with all of our productions representing the nodes that make up the larger structure. Unique productions, under one roof.
            </p>
            <p>
                The inclusion of the olive tree comes from 2 distinct areas. The first area comes from what olive trees represent in the Bible. The olive tree represents peace, life, and prosperity. The commonly known symbol of peace — a dove with an olive tree branch! The world certainly isn't getting more peaceful, and while we certainly aren't out to bring world peace, we hope to bring just a bit of an escape for people with our little studio's productions.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second area comes from the importance of olive trees throughout human history. Olive trees have long been a source of prosperity. They produce, shockingly, olives and olive oil. Both used almost globally. Back in old times, olive oil was almost as valuable as gold. Nations with olive trees grew prosperous. So if we want to help creatives with a vision bring their productions to life… why not throw some olives at them?
            </p>

            <h2 class="olive-bold">Our Contributors</h2>

Regardless of someone's fine contribution, everyone shares one simple thing — a passion to make some darn cool stuff.
